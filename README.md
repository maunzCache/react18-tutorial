# react18-tutorial

As described by https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe (as long as this link works though).

## Rationale

I wanted to get to know React a little bit better as I have been working on a browser game that is going to be migrated from vanilla JS to React. There is no real reason for this migration other that it can be done I was interested in doing this.

However, what was learned years before utilizing jQuery and other former state-of-the art frameworks and tools, my ideas wouldn't work the way I expected them to work. Thus, my idea was to learn React be the tutorial and not by migrating code that I know.

## Setup

Instead of building in the NodeJS space, I was interested in using [deno](https://deno.com/) for the resolving dependencies and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for transpiling and bundling.

In fact, it is an easy setup to get working with React using pure JavaScript (plus JSX obviously).
